# hardware revisions

during the supposed lifespan of specs2, many revisions of the hardware were made.

- r0: prototype, never released
- r1: first public release
  - main RAM: 1M
  - sound chip RAM: 8K
  - processor locked to master clock
- r2: second release after the amiga
  - main RAM: 2M
  - sound chip RAM: 64K
    (this revision mentions the PCM capability in the programmer's manual)
  - processor locked to master clock
- r3: third release
  - main RAM: 2M home, 4M business
  - sound chip RAM: 64K
  - processor clocked independently
    - as such this machine has a 12MHz processor, to combat the Unix workstations
- r4: final release before specs3
  - main RAM: 4M home, 8M business
  - sound chip RAM: 64K
  - processor locked to master clock
    - but running at 1/2 the master clock
    - as such, it runs at 14.875MHz or 15.45MHz
  - this revision didn't sell well, due to its locked processor
