# character unit

this chip provides text mode output.

it has 32KB of memory.

the first 24KB block contains the characters to be output (128x48 maximum), in the following format:

addr | description
-----|--------------------
 $00 | character
 $01 | color
 $02 | background color
 $03 | attributes:
     | bit 2-6: select page (kanji only)
     | bit 1: blink background
     | bit 0: blink text

there are a few special registers at the end of this block:

addr | description
-----|--------------------
$5fe0| VCACNT line size
     | - 800
$5fe2| VCAHBL pre hblank size
     | - 58
$5fe3| VCAHBP post hblank size
     | - 24
$5fe4| VCABLU upper blanking lines
     | - 23
$5fe5| VCABLL lower blanking lines
     | - 6 or 10
     | - 16 or 8 lines are added for sync.
$5fe6| VCAACT active size
     | - 480 or 576
$5fe8| VCHSY0 size of equalizing pulse/horizontal sync (low)
     | - 70
$5fe9| VCHSY1 size of frame sync pulse (high)
     | - 140
$5fea| VCHSZ0 size of equalizing pulse (high)
     | - 882
$5fec| VCHSZ1 size of sync pulse (low)
     | - 812
$5fee| VCTRL video control
     | - bit 4: force blank
     | - bit 3: half vertical mode
     |   - set for TV compatibility.
     | - bit 2: video mode
     |   - 0: progressive
     |   - 1: interlaced
     | - bit 0-1: horizontal divider
     |   - 0: 800
     |   - 1: 400
     |   - 2: ~267
     |   - 3: 200
     |   - only affects active area.
$5fef| EXTSYN external sync control
     | - bit 0: sync to video chip
$5ff0| CURX cursor X
$5ff1| CURY cursor Y
$5ff2| TSIZEX text width
$5ff3| TSIZEY text height
$5ff4| TSCRX text offset X
$5ff5| TSCRY text offset Y
$5ffa| STATUS internal status (read-only):
     | - bit 6: putchar advances cursor
     | - bit 5: blink status
     | - bit 0-4: blink counter
$5ffa| FLAGS flags (write-only):
     | - bit 1: character depth
     |   - 0: monochrome
     |   - 1: 3-tone
     | - bit 0: character size
     |   - 0: 8x16
     |   - 1: 16x16 (monochrome only)
$5ffc| CMD command: when written, the chip
     |          can perform several
     |          operations, listed:
     | - $00: NOP nothing
     | - $01: LF newline
     | - $02: CLR clear screen
     | - $03: CLC clear with color
     | - $04: PCS putchar static
     | - $05: PCA putchar advances cursor
     | - $06: DEL backspace
     | - $80: force vsync
     | - $81: force hsync
$5ffd| PUTCBK putchar background
$5ffe| PUTCOL putchar color
$5fff| PUTCHR putchar

the last 8KB block contains the current font in two bit planes.

an optional ROM (e.g. Kanji) may be added for expanding the character set.
