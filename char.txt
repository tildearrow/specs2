# character unit

this chip provides text mode output.

it has 32KB of memory.

the first 24KB block contains the characters to be output (128x48 maximum), in the following format:

addr | description
-----|--------------------
 $00 | character
 $01 | page/attributes:
     | bit 7: blink background
     | bit 6: blink text
     | bit 0-5: select page
     | - 0/1: RAM ($6000 and $7000)
     | - 2: character expansion ROM
     | - bit 0 is ineffective in 16x16 mode.
 $02 | color
 $03 | background color

there are a few special registers at the end of this block:

     | - bit 0-3: character height (+1)
$5ffc| CMD command: when written, the chip
     |          can perform several
     |          operations, listed:
     | - $00: NOP nothing
     | - $01: LF newline
     | - $02: CLR clear screen
     | - $03: CLC clear with color
     | - $04: DEL backspace
     | - $80: force vsync
     | - $81: force hsync
$5ffd| PUTCBK putchar background
$5ffe| PUTCOL putchar color
$5fff| PUTCHR putchar

the last 8KB block contains the current font (two 8x16 pages).

an optional ROM (e.g. Kanji) may be added for expanding the character set.
