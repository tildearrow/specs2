# memory map

this is the memory map in unpaged state.

addr    | meaning
--------|-------------------
$000000 | system RAM, up to 15MB
$f00000 | video unit
$fe0000 | character unit
$ff0000 | core
$ffc000 | sound unit
$ffffff | map density register
        | - writing to this register changes the map density which sets
        |   how many 64KB blocks will be available for hardware
        | - by using this setting it is possible to have access to 16MB
        |   of memory at the cost of being unable to access hardware
        | - this register is set to $f0 at power on
        | - this register is hardwired to the core, and is always available

---boot routine---
upon powering the system on, a tiny loader (initial system loader) is available at $fffe00, which is the initial value of PC in the CPU.
the routine copies the system BIOS ROM to $8000 (up to 32KB, but could be bigger), and jumps there.
the BIOS initializes the hardware and boots from the first available disk.
if the disk is bootable, it copies its 2048 bytes boot block to $800 and jumps there.
